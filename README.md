# time_it

time-it is an application for timing another application. this is a crystal implementation. the basis for this is my original [python implementation](https://github.com/elliethepuppy/time-it). you can read the full documentation [here](https://elliethepuppy.github.io/time-it)

## Installation

to install, you can build from source, or download a compiled binary from the releases section.

build instructions are simple. from the `time-it-cr` directory, run

``` bash
crystal build src/main.cr -o /path/to/destination/for/time-it --release --no-debug
```

## Usage

in order to call `time-it` from anywhere, you'll need to add it to your PATH. you can do this any number of ways, so i'll leave you to deciding the best for you. you can read the full documentation [here](https://elliethepuppy.github.io/time-it)

## Development

there's no real need to develop on top of this, so i leave it to you to determine the best methods for that.
